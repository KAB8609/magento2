Update as of 3/26/2012
======================

* Introduced concept of containers and "page types" in layout.
  * Containers replace `Mage_Core_Block_Text_List` and `Mage_Page_Block_Html_Wrapper`
  * Widgets now utilize page types and containers instead of "handles" and "block references"
* Implemented first draft of visual design editor with the following capabilities
  * highlighting and dragging blocks and containers, toggling highlighting on/off
  * switching to arbitrary theme and skin
  * navigating to arbitrary page types (product view, order success page, etc...), so that they would be editable with visual design editor
* Refactored various places across the system in order to accommodate transition to containers, page types and visual design editor, which includes
  * Output in any frontend controller action using layout only
  * Output in any frontend controller specifies one and only one layout handle, which equals to its full action name. There can be other handles that extend it and they are determined by layout loading parameters, provided by controller.
  * No program termination (exit) on logging in admin user
  * Session cookie lifetime is set to 0 for frontend and backend. Session will exist until browser window is open, however backend session lifetime limitation does not depend on cookie lifetime anymore.
