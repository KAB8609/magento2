MAGENTO(tm) PROFESSIONAL EDITION
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between
Magento, Inc. ("Magento") and the Licensee executing the Magento Order Form
(defined below). The parties agree as follows:

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.  License
    1.1. Subject to Licensee's payment of the applicable fees and to Licensee's
    compliance with other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Magento grants
    Licensee a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, worldwide
    license to use, modify and create derivative works in respect of the Software,
    solely for internal purposes, in accordance with the Software's technical
    documentation and solely during the periods and on the maximum number of
    Designated Servers specified in one or more applicable Magento or
    Magento-authorized reseller ordering schedules (the "Magento Order Form")
    executed with Licensee. Magento also grants Licensee the right to contribute any
    derivative works in respect of the Software back to Magento. Licensee may
    contact Magento for more information.

    1.2. In the event that Licensee's actual number of Servers of a particular
    Software license exceeds the licensed number of Designated Servers on such
    license, Licensee shall promptly provide Magento with written notice and pay
    Magento the fees required to license such additional Server(s) in accordance
    with the commercial terms set out in the Magento Order Form.

    1.3. Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does not
    exceed the maximum number of licensed Servers of the Software. Magento reserves
    the right to audit Licensee's use of the Software during normal business hours
    and with reasonable notice and to include means within the Software to limit
    Licensee's use of the Software to the licensed number of Servers.

    1.4. Magento shall provide to Licensee an initial copy of the Software,
    including the associated technical documentation, for use by Licensee in
    accordance with this Agreement. Subject to Sections 1.1-1.3 above, Licensee is
    authorized to make a reasonable number of non-Server copies of the Software,
    e.g., onto a local pc, as it requires for purpose of exercising its rights under
    this Agreement.

    1.5. Licensee is authorized to use the Software on a single substitute or backup
    Server on a temporary basis without charge any time a Designated Server is
    inoperative due to a malfunction beyond the control of Licensee. Licensee may
    transfer the Software on a permanent basis to a single replacement Server
    without charge. Licensee agrees to provide Magento with written notice,
    including the Server type and operating system, of any such transfer to a backup
    or replacement Server within five (5) days after such transfer.

    1.6. Licensee acknowledges that portions of the Software are also freely
    available to the public under Magento's open source version of the Software,
    known as Magento Community Edition subject to certain conditions, with limited
    warranties and other limited assurances, and without service or support. As an
    express condition for the license granted hereunder, Licensee agrees that any
    use during the term of such open source versions of the Software, whether in a
    Production Server Instance or a Non-Production Server Instance, shall be deemed
    use of the Software for purposes of the calculation of fees payable under the
    Agreement.

2.  License Exclusions
    2.1. Except as expressly authorized herein, Licensee shall not:
        a. use or deploy the Software on any Server in excess of the number of
        Designated Servers specified in the applicable Magento Order Form;

        b. distribute, sublicense, disclose, market, rent, lease, or offer remote
        computing services, networking, batch processing or transfer of, the Software to
        any third party, or permit any person or entity to have access to the Software
        by means of a time sharing, remote computing services, networking, batch
        processing, service bureau or time sharing arrangement;

        c. export the Software in violation of U.S. Department of Commerce export
        administration regulations.

    2.2. No license, right or interest in any Magento trademark, trade name or
    service mark is granted hereunder.

3.  Fees and Payment Terms
    Fees and payment terms are set forth in each Magento Order Form executed with
    Licensee.

4.  Title and Protection
    4.1. Magento (or its third party providers) retains title to all portions of the
    Software and any copies thereof. The Software contains valuable proprietary
    information, and Licensee shall not disclose the Software to anyone other than
    those of its employees or consultants under written nondisclosure obligations at
    least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement, having a need to know
    for purposes consistent with this Agreement. Licensee shall be responsible for
    the compliance of such employees or consultants. Licensee shall affix, to each
    full or partial copy of the Software made by Licensee, all copyright and
    proprietary information notices as were affixed to the original. The obligations
    set forth in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.

    4.2. Licensee acknowledges that the Software includes certain open source
    software which is governed by the applicable license terms thereof. A list of
    such open source software, as amended from time to time, including the links
    applicable to such open source software is specified in the product release
    notes for each Software version. The use of the open source software bundled
    within the Software is subject to the provisions of such license agreements, and
    in the event of any contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement and
    the provisions of such applicable license agreement, the provisions of the
    applicable open source license agreement shall prevail solely with respect to
    such open source software products, Magento makes no indemnity with respect to
    any open source code included within the Software, and for greater clarity, the
    indemnity set out in Section 5 (Patent and Copyright Indemnity)below does not
    apply to any such open source code.

    4.3. If the Software is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S.
    Government (the "Government"), the Government agrees that such Product is
    "commercial computer software" or "commercial computer software documentation"
    and that, absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Government's rights
    with respect to such Product are limited by the terms of this Agreement,
    pursuant to applicable FAR and/or DFARS and successor regulations.

5.  Patent and Copyright Indemnity
    For such time as Licensee is current on paying the annual fees, Magento shall
    indemnify and defend Licensee against any claims that the Software infringes any
    United States or European patent or copyright; provided that Magento is given
    prompt notice of such claim and is given information, reasonable assistance and
    sole authority to defend or settle the claim. In the defense or settlement of
    the claim, Magento shall obtain for Licensee the right to continue using the
    Software, replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while
    giving equivalent performance or, if Magento determines that such remedies are
    not reasonably available, remove the infringing portion of the Software, accept
    its return and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid but unused fees for
    the use of such Software license. Magento shall have no liability if the alleged
    infringement is based on (i) a modification of the Software by anyone other
    than, or a combination of the Software with any product or service not provided
    by, Magento; (ii) use of the Software with one or more Servers not listed in the
    applicable Magento Order Form; or (iii) use of the Software other than in
    accordance with the documentation. This Section 5 states Magento's entire
    liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy for infringement.

6.  Default and Termination
    6.1. An event of default shall be deemed to occur if: (i) Licensee fails to
    perform any of its obligations under the Sections entitled "License Exclusions"
    or "Title and Protection"; (ii) Licensee fails to pay amounts due within seven
    (7) days of the relevant due date; or (iii) either party fails to perform any
    other material obligation under this Agreement and such failure remains uncured
    for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.

    6.2. If an event of default occurs, the non-defaulting party, in addition to any
    other rights available to it under the law, may terminate this Agreement and all
    licenses granted hereunder by written notice to the defaulting party. Remedies
    shall be cumulative and there shall be no obligation to exercise a particular
    remedy.

    6.3. Within thirty (30) days after termination of the Software license or
    expiration of the license term specified in the Magento Order Form, Licensee
    shall certify in writing to Magento that Licensee has ceased use of the Software
    and that all copies of the Software in any form, including partial copies within
    modified versions, have been destroyed.

7.  Warranty
    7.1. Warranty for Software. Magento warrants for a single period of sixty (60)
    days commencing upon Magento's electronic delivery of the Software to Licensee
    that the Software will in all material respects perform the functions described
    in the specifications contained in the documentation provided with the Software.
    Magento does not warrant that the Software will meet Licensee's requirements,
    that the Software will operate in the combinations which Licensee may select for
    use, that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or
    that all error conditions will be corrected. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION
    ALL SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED "AS IS".

    7.2. DISCLAIMER. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE THE ONLY
    WARRANTIES MADE BY MAGENTO WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY MAGENTO.
    MAGENTO MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR ARISING BY CUSTOM OR
    TRADE USAGE, AND, SPECIFICALLY, MAKES NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
    FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MAGENTO'S EXPRESS WARRANTIES SHALL NOT BE ENLARGED,
    DIMINISHED OR AFFECTED BY, AND NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY SHALL ARISE OUT OF,
    MAGENTO RENDERING TECHNICAL OR OTHER ADVICE OR SERVICE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
    SOFTWARE.

8.  Limitation of Liability
    8.1. LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT
    EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF THE LICENSES OR RELATED RESTRICTIONS
    CONTAINED HEREIN OR ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW. SAVE FOR THE FOREGOING, NEITHER PARTY ACCEPTS AND EACH PARTY
    HEREBY EXCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE PROPERTY OTHER
    THAN THAT CAUSED BY ITS NEGLIGENCE AND HEREBY EXCLUDES ANY OTHER LIABILITY FOR

    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE.

    OTHERWISE) IN WHICH ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT, IN NO EVENT
    WILL MAGENTO OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, RESTITUTION OR LOSSES, THAT
    EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, FOR EACH RESPECTIVE BREACH OR SERIES OF RELATED
    BREACHES, THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE IN THE
    TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO
    SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES OCCURRED.

9.  Support Services Terms and Conditions
    Support is not included in the Magento Professional Edition License Fee. End
    user support may be provided by the Magento Authorized Reseller.

10. Joint Marketing Activities
    The parties shall cooperate to undertake mutually agreed joint marketing
    activities.

11. Notices
    All notices shall be in writing and sent by first class mail or overnight mail
    (or courier), transmitted by facsimile (if confirmed by such mailing), or email,
    to the addresses indicated on the Magento Order Form, or such other address as
    either party may indicate by at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the
    other party. Notices to Magento shall be sent to the Contracts Administration
    Department.

12. Assignment
    Licensee may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of
    Magento; provided that such consent shall not be required for assignment to a
    purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets or equity securities of
    Licensee who undertakes in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions
    of this Agreement. Any prohibited assignment shall be null and void.

13. Entire Agreement
    Along with the Magento Order Form, this Agreement is the complete and exclusive
    agreement between the parties, which supersedes all proposals or prior
    agreements, oral or written, including any online (click-through) agreement
    which Licensee may have accepted in conjunction with the downloading of the
    Software, and all other communications between the parties relating to the
    subject matter hereof. No purchase order, other ordering document or any hand
    written or typewritten text which purports to modify or supplement the printed
    text hereof or Magento Order Form shall add to or vary the terms thereof. Except
    as contained in a writing signed by both parties, all such proposed variations
    or additions are objected to and shall have no force or effect.

14. General
    This Agreement is made in and shall be governed by the laws of the State of
    California, excluding choice of law principles. All proceedings shall be
    conducted in English. Venue for all proceedings shall be Los Angeles County,
    California, provided that Magento may seek injunctive relief in any court of
    competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale
    of Goods shall not apply. The section headings herein are provided for
    convenience only and have no substantive effect on the construction of this
    Agreement. Except for Licensee's obligation to pay Magento, neither party shall
    be liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable
    control. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
    Agreement shall be construed without such provision. The failure by a party to
    exercise any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such party's right
    to exercise such right or any other right in the future. This Agreement may be
    amended only by a written document executed by a duly authorized representative
    of each of the parties. The parties agree to receive electronic documents and
    accept electronic signatures (information attached or logically associated with
    such document and clicked or otherwise adopted with an intent to sign) including
    in counterparts which shall be valid substitutes for paper-based documents and
    signatures, and the legal validity of a transaction will not be denied on the
    ground that it is not in writing.

15. Definitions
    "Designated Server" shall mean the Server specified in a Magento Order Form with
    respect to a particular Software license. Such Server may be that of a
    third-party under nondisclosure obligations that will host the Software for the
    benefit of Licensee.

    "Modifications" means any code developed by Licensee or any third party,
    including without limitation, configuration, integrations, implementations, or
    localizations to the external layer of the core, baseline Software product. The
    term "Modifications" excludes Updates provided by Magento.

    "Proprietary Material" means the Software, related documentation, and all parts,
    copies and modifications thereof, and any other information, in whatever form,
    received by a party hereunder from the other party or its licensors which is
    identified in writing as being proprietary or confidential, provided, however,
    such information shall not be deemed Proprietary Material if it (a) is or
    becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other
    party; or (b) was in the other party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure
    and had not been obtained by the other party from the disclosing party; or (c)
    is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party without restriction on
    disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by a party without reference to or
    use of the other party’s Proprietary Material.

    "Server" means each physical or virtual server from which a single instance of
    the Software is accessed and used either for production purposes ("Production
    Server Instance") or for non-production purposes, such as development, testing,
    training and other non-operational business transactions ("Non-Production Server
    Instance"). For example, if one server contains two (2) instances of the
    Software, i.e., one Production Server Instance and one Non-Production Server
    Instance, then a Server license is required for each of such instances;
    development in-house and by third-party consultants requires licenses for two
    Non-Production Server Instances.

    "Software" means Magento's proprietary e-commerce software solution known as the
    MagentoTM Professional Edition, provided solely in source code, including
    associated technical documentation, and all Updates thereof furnished to
    Licensee. Except as otherwise specified herein, the term Software includes
    certain open source software programs described in Section 4.2. "Software” does
    not include any Modifications.

    "Updates" means all published revisions and corrections to the printed
    documentation and corrections and new releases of the Software which are
    generally made available to Magento's customers at no additional cost or for
    media and handling charges only. Updates shall not include any options or future
    products which Magento sells separately.
