<p class="a-center"><strong>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong></p>

<p>This End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>")
is entered into by and between Magento, Inc. ("<strong>Magento</strong>") and
the Licensee executing the Magento Order Form (defined below) . The parties
agree as follows:</p>

<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p><strong>1. License</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.1.</strong> Subject to Licensee's
payment of the applicable fees and to Licensee's compliance with other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Magento grants Licensee a non-transferable,
non-assignable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use, modify and create
derivative works in respect of the Software, solely for internal purposes, in
accordance with the Software's technical documentation and solely during the
periods and on the maximum number of Designated Servers specified in one or
more applicable Magento or Magento-authorized reseller ordering schedules (the
"Magento Order Form") executed with Licensee. Magento also grants
Licensee the right to contribute any derivative works in respect of the
Software back to Magento. Licensee may contact Magento for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.2.</strong> In the event that
Licensee's actual number of Servers of a particular Software license exceeds
the licensed number of Designated Servers on such license, Licensee shall
promptly provide Magento with written notice and pay Magento the fees required
to license such additional Server(s) in accordance with the commercial terms
set out in the Magento Order Form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.3.</strong> Licensee shall
implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum
number of licensed Servers of the Software. Magento reserves the right to audit
Licensee's use of the Software during normal business hours and with reasonable
notice and to include means within the Software to limit Licensee's use of the
Software to the licensed number of Servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.4.</strong> Magento shall provide
to Licensee an initial copy of the Software, including the associated technical
documentation, for use by Licensee in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to Sections 1.1-1.3 above, Licensee is authorized to make a reasonable number
of non-Server copies of the Software, e.g., onto a local pc, as it requires for
purpose of exercising its rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.5.</strong> Licensee is authorized
to use the Software on a single substitute or backup Server on a temporary
basis without charge any time a Designated Server is inoperative due to a
malfunction beyond the control of Licensee. Licensee may transfer the Software
on a permanent basis to a single replacement Server without charge. Licensee
agrees to provide Magento with written notice, including the Server type and
operating system, of any such transfer to a backup or replacement Server within
five (5) days after such transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>1.6.</strong> Licensee acknowledges
that portions of the Software are also freely available to the public under
Magento's open source version of the Software, known as Magento Community
Edition subject to certain conditions, with limited warranties and other
limited assurances, and without service or support. As an express condition for
the license granted hereunder, Licensee agrees that any use during the term of
such open source versions of the Software, whether in a Production Server
Instance or a Non-Production Server Instance, shall be deemed use of the
Software for purposes of the calculation of fees payable under the Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>2. License Exclusions</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>2.1.</strong> Except as expressly
authorized herein, Licensee shall not:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.6in">a. use or deploy the Software on
any Server in excess of the number of Designated Servers specified in the
applicable Magento Order Form;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.6in">b. distribute, sublicense,
disclose, market, rent, lease, or offer remote computing services, networking,
batch processing or transfer of, the Software to any third party, or permit any
person or entity to have access to the Software by means of a time sharing,
remote computing services, networking, batch processing, service bureau or time
sharing arrangement;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.6in">c. export the Software in violation
of U.S. Department of Commerce export administration regulations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>2.2.</strong> No license, right or
interest in any Magento trademark, trade name or service mark is granted
hereunder.</p>

<p><strong>3. Fees and Payment Terms</strong></p>

<p>Fees and payment terms are set forth in each Magento Order
Form executed with Licensee.</p>

<p><strong>4. Title and Protection</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>4.1.</strong> Magento (or its third
party providers) retains title to all portions of the Software and any copies
thereof. The Software contains valuable proprietary information, and Licensee
shall not disclose the Software to anyone other than those of its employees or
consultants under written nondisclosure obligations at least as restrictive as
those contained in this Agreement, having a need to know for purposes
consistent with this Agreement. Licensee shall be responsible for the
compliance of such employees or consultants. Licensee shall affix, to each full
or partial copy of the Software made by Licensee, all copyright and proprietary
information notices as were affixed to the original. The obligations set forth
in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>4.2.</strong> Licensee acknowledges
that the Software includes certain open source software which is governed by
the applicable license terms thereof. A list of such open source software, as
amended from time to time, including the links applicable to such open source
software is specified in the product release notes for each Software version.
The use of the open source software bundled within the Software is subject to
the provisions of such license agreements, and in the event of any
contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of
such applicable license agreement, the provisions of the applicable open source
license agreement shall prevail solely with respect to such open source
software products, Magento makes no indemnity with respect to any open source
code included within the Software, and for greater clarity, the indemnity set
out in Section 5 <i>(Patent and Copyright Indemnity)</i>below does not
apply to any such open source code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>4.3.</strong> If the Software is
acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S. Government (the "<strong>Government</strong>"),
the Government agrees that such Product is "commercial computer
software" or "commercial computer software documentation" and
that, absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Government's rights with
respect to such Product are limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to
applicable FAR and/or DFARS and successor regulations.</p>

<p><strong>5. Patent and Copyright Indemnity</strong></p>

<p>For such time as Licensee is current on paying the annual
fees, Magento shall indemnify and defend Licensee against any claims that the
Software infringes any United States or European patent or copyright; provided
that Magento is given prompt notice of such claim and is given information,
reasonable assistance and sole authority to defend or settle the claim. In the
defense or settlement of the claim, Magento shall obtain for Licensee the right
to continue using the Software, replace or modify the Software so that it
becomes non-infringing while giving equivalent performance or, if Magento
determines that such remedies are not reasonably available, remove the
infringing portion of the Software, accept its return and refund the prorated
portion of any prepaid but unused fees for the use of such Software license.
Magento shall have no liability if the alleged infringement is based on (i) a
modification of the Software by anyone other than, or a combination of the
Software with any product or service not provided by, Magento; (ii) use of the
Software with one or more Servers not listed in the applicable Magento Order
Form; or (iii) use of the Software other than in accordance with the
documentation. This Section 5 states Magento's entire liability and Licensee's
exclusive remedy for infringement.</p>

<p><strong>6. Default and Termination</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>6.1.</strong> An event of default
shall be deemed to occur if: (i) Licensee fails to perform any of its
obligations under the Sections entitled "License Exclusions" or
"Title and Protection"; (ii) Licensee fails to pay amounts due within
seven (7) days of the relevant due date; or (iii) either party fails to perform
any other material obligation under this Agreement and such failure remains
uncured for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>6.2.</strong> If an event of default
occurs, the non-defaulting party, in addition to any other rights available to
it under the law, may terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted
hereunder by written notice to the defaulting party. Remedies shall be
cumulative and there shall be no obligation to exercise a particular remedy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>6.3.</strong> Within thirty (30) days
after termination of the Software license or expiration of the license term
specified in the Magento Order Form, Licensee shall certify in writing to
Magento that Licensee has ceased use of the Software and that all copies of the
Software in any form, including partial copies within modified versions, have
been destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>7. Warranty</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.3in"><strong>7.1.</strong> <u>Warranty for
Software.</u> Magento warrants for a single period of sixty (60) days
commencing upon Magento's electronic delivery of the Software to Licensee that
the Software will in all material respects perform the functions described in
the specifications contained in the documentation provided with the Software.
Magento does not warrant that the Software will meet Licensee's requirements,
that the Software will operate in the combinations which Licensee may select
for use, that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or
error-free, or that all error conditions will be corrected. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED
IN THIS SECTION ALL SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED "AS IS".</p>

<p><strong>13. Entire Agreement</strong></p>

<p>Along with the Magento Order Form, this Agreement is the
complete and exclusive agreement between the parties, which supersedes all
proposals or prior agreements, oral or written, including any online
(click-through) agreement which Licensee may have accepted in conjunction with
the downloading of the Software, and all other communications between the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof. No purchase order, other
ordering document or any hand written or typewritten text which purports to
modify or supplement the printed text hereof or Magento Order Form shall add to
or vary the terms thereof. Except as contained in a writing signed by both
parties, all such proposed variations or additions are objected to and shall
have no force or effect.</p>

<p><strong>14. General</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement is made in and shall be governed by the laws
of the State of California, excluding choice of law principles. All proceedings
shall be conducted in English. Venue for all proceedings shall be Los Angeles
County, California, provided that Magento may seek injunctive relief in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention for the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply. The section headings herein are
provided for convenience only and have no substantive effect on the
construction of this Agreement. Except for Licensee's obligation to pay
Magento, neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform due to causes
beyond its reasonable control. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be construed without such provision. The
failure by a party to exercise any right hereunder shall not operate as a
waiver of such party's right to exercise such right or any other right in the
future. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document executed by a
duly authorized representative of each of the parties. The parties agree to
receive electronic documents and accept electronic signatures (information
attached or logically associated with such document and clicked or otherwise
adopted with an intent to sign) including in counterparts which shall be valid
substitutes for paper-based documents and signatures, and the legal validity of
a transaction will not be denied on the ground that it is not in writing.</p>

<p><strong>15. Definitions</strong></p>

<p>"<strong>Designated Server</strong>" shall mean the Server
specified in a Magento Order Form with respect to a particular Software
license. Such Server may be that of a third-party under nondisclosure
obligations that will host the Software for the benefit of Licensee.</p>

<p>"<strong>Modifications</strong>" means any code developed by
Licensee or any third party, including without limitation, configuration,
integrations, implementations, or localizations to the external layer of the
core, baseline Software product. The term "Modifications" excludes
Updates provided by Magento.</p>

<p>"<strong>Proprietary Material</strong>" means the Software,
related documentation, and all parts, copies and modifications thereof, and any
other information, in whatever form, received by a party hereunder from the
other party or its licensors which is identified in writing as being
proprietary or confidential, provided, however, such information shall not be
deemed Proprietary Material if it (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain
through no act or omission of the other party; or (b) was in the other party's
lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the
other party from the disclosing party; or (c) is lawfully disclosed to the
other party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is
independently developed by a party without reference to or use of the other
party's Proprietary Material.</p>

For example, if one server contains two (2) instances of the Software, i.e.,
one Production Server Instance and one Non-Production Server Instance, then a
Server license is required for each of such instances; development in-house and
by third-party consultants requires licenses for two Non-Production Server
Instances.</p>

e-commerce software solution known as the Magento&trade; Professional
Edition, provided solely in source code, including associated technical
documentation, and all Updates thereof furnished to Licensee. Except as
